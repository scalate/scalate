We really want you to get involved in the {project_name:} and we love [contributions!](contributing.html). One of the easiest ways to get involved is to join the community discussions...

# Developer Mailing List

The developer list is used for general discussions and ideas about the code and how to use it.

# Commit Mailing List

The commit list is notified of all changes to the source code or changes to [issues](support.html) so you can use this list to watch development and support occur.
