----

* Built against scala 2.10
* support stripping newlines from output in SSP templates
* Test that consecutive Jade includes work.
* unexpected fragment in parse results: improved error reporting, empty string is emitted instead of "()" - representation of Unit returned from println
* use zinc server for incremental compilation when available
* java.io.File.toUrl is deprecated
* Predef.error is deprecated in Scala 2.10
* Applications should never catch subclasses of java.lang.Error
* Remove unused scala-mojo-support from POM.
* Precompiled template loading was broken.  If the compiler is not installed, throws a ResourceNotFoundException instead of a TemplateException since we don't want to short circuit attempting to load other templates which might be precompiled.
* When Global is not on the classpath, a Throwable is thrown, not an Exception.
* disable maven.glassfish.org (nexus is now maven.java.net), there's some transitive dependency calling this that causes problems for maven-scalate-plugin if you don't have it cached locally
* Fix method name used in reflection.
* convert to mixed java/scala module so we can use the standard Maven Java Mojo extractors.  Drop use the the scala-mojo support.
* It's a jar not a bundle.
* Fix maven-compat version.
* Clean up pom so that build works.
* Fix bad group ID on scalatra-mojo-support.
* scalamd has been published upstream, roll back to it.
* Use public versions of all plugins; now builds clean with -Pdownload.
* Removed pure expression in statement position, according to scalac warning.
* Hide Tuple style accessors _1, _2 etc because IntrospectorTest does not expect to see them. The test failure could be fixed the other way around, but my feeling is that named properties are more useful inside a template than numbered ones.
* Adjusted to scala.tools.nsc.io.AbstractFile API change
* Fixed "missing parameter type" error.
* scalate-util module declares packaging type bundle. Update dependency coordinate to match that.
* Update artifactIDs on website with Scala binary compatibility tag.

* scalamd has been published upstream, roll back to it.
* Use public versions of all plugins; now builds clean with -Pdownload.
* Upgrade to scala-maven-plugin 3.1.0 for incremental compilation.
* Revert "Enable commented LoopTest."

* Move addon filters into their own subpackages
* Enable commented LoopTest.
* Scala Tools is dead. Long live Sonatype.
* Changes to support OSGi with 2.10.0
* Discarding exception: let all subclasses of Error pass unaffected. When a class is found on the classpath but could not be loaded due to an LinkageError, the developer needs to know about this.
* Discarding caught exception: let subclasses of Error pass unaffected
* Rethrowing exception: use explicit Throwable type ascription to pacify the compiler
* Exception wrapping: let VirtualMachineError and ThreadDeath pass unaffected
* Removed redundant try/catch
* updated mvnplugins to 1.27-SNAPSHOT, awaiting Scala 2.10 compatible release
* Removed pure expression in statement position, according to scalac warning.
* Fixed a deprecation warning: pass on minimizeEmpty property of Element being processed
* Hide Tuple style accessors _1, _2 etc because IntrospectorTest does not expect to see them. The test failure could be fixed the other way around, but my feeling is that named properties are more useful inside a template than numbered ones.
* Fixed some deprecation warnings in the compiler
* Scala 2.10: scala.reflect.ClassTag instead of scala.reflect.Manifest
* Removed explicit adding of scala-library, scala-compiler and scalate-core bundles to compiler classpath. Client bundle needs to import relevant packages anyway to load the classes later, so the necessary bundles will be added by ClassPathBuilder.fromBundle.
* Add bundle to classpath only once irregardles of the number of imported packages. LinkedHashSet is used to preserve correct order.
* Override Global.classPath to our generated classpath.
* Do not create ServletTemplateEngine for every view, reuse once created one. Invoke boot class.
* Switched from presentation compiler to regular one to get around bytecode generation problem. See: https://gist.github.com/3488314
* Adjust to scala compiler API change.

* Add a shutdown method on Compiler
* Now that TemplateEngine uses a ScalaCompiler, it needs a method for shutting it down.
* Scaml declarations use at signs, not ampersands. Thanks, josiahg.
* Update 500.scaml to import scala.util.parsing.input.Position by full name instead of relative package.

[Scalate 1.3.2](http://scalate.fusesource.org/blog/releases/release-1-3-2.html), released 2010-11-24
----

* new [set](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#set) [velocity directive](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#velocity_style_directives) in [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) which lets you assign sections of the template output to attributes so you can more easily pass information into layouts.
* minor refactoring of internal classes such as Resource and ResourceLoader from the org.fusesource.scalate.support package into the org.fusesource.scalate.util package to make the util package more stand alone and reuseable outside of Scalate.

----

* for folks migrating from Erb, [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) now supports Erb style comments

[Scalate 1.3](http://scalate.fusesource.org/blog/releases/release-1-3.html), released 2010-10-08
----

* [Jade](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html#jade) template syntax is now supported which is a dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) or [Scaml](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html)
* New [Servlet Filter](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/user-guide.html#using_scalate_as_servlet_filter_in_your_web_application) which allows more flexible mapping of templates in a web application. For example you can have the request */foo.xml* automatically bound to */foo.xml.ssp* if the template exists letting you easily implement views without requiring a controller or routing in your MVC layer. 
* [JSP Converter](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/jspConvert.html) helps you migrate your existing JSP web application across to Scalate
* [HTML Converter](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/htmlConvert.html) lets you migrate your existing HTML files easily to [Scaml](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html) or [Jade](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html#jade) for extra DRY markup 
* [DRY template imports, values and logic](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/user-guide.html#dry) thanks to Scalate Package objects which allow imports, values and methods to be shared across some or all of your templates to reduce noise inside your templates.
* [Site Generator](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/siteGen.html) lets you generate static or dynamic websites using templates and/or wiki markup together with exporting wiki content from Confluence wikis to migrate to using git/svn as your wiki content repository. You can also use [a common bootstrap approach](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/siteGen.html#bootstrapping) now across both static website generation and web applications - such as to configure wiki macros in a canonical way. We now eat our own dog food and generate this site using Scalate.
* More filters and pipelines supported such as confluence as well as the existing markdown which are particularly useful for website generation (static or semi-static).
* The [Scalate Tool](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/tool.html) now comes with a full interactive shell with full tab completion to make it easier to use the tool either for ad hoc or interactive shell use.

[Scalate 1.2](http://scalate.fusesource.org/blog/releases/release-1-2.html), released 2010-07-30
----

* Scalate now supports the [Mustache](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/mustache.html) template language which is a Scala dialect of [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js). Support for Mustache uses the same common Scalate API so it works with all the existing Scalate adapters such as servlets, [JAXRS](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/jog.html), [Lift](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/lift.html) or [Play](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) and [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html)
* Scalate is [now built](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/70) on top of [Scala 2.8.0 final release](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/7009) 
* [Scuery](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scuery.html) for jQuery style transformation of HTML or XHTML using CSS3 selectors
* the [console](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/console.html) can be more easily reused in your application [without using WAR overlays](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/105) and templates can be loaded via the classloader to help make more modular web applications without relying on WAR overlays
* [improvements](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/94) in associating different template languages to files/URIs/strings/streams in a more flexible API
* [various](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/108) [improvements](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/109) in the accuracy of the mapping of scala compiler errors to positions in the template source file which are then shown and linked in the [console](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/console.html)
* improved [maven plugin](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/user-guide.html#precompiling_templates) for precompiling templates

[Scalate 1.1](http://scalate.fusesource.org/blog/releases/release-1-1.html), released 2010-04-15
----

* [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) now supports [Velocity style directives](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#velocity_style_directives) for more concise looping and branching.
* new [Scalate Tool](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/tool.html) for creating new projects with Scalate more easily
* improved API for working with templates from different sources (file, URL, Source, String etc) via the helper methods on [TemplateSource object](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateSource$.html) and methods on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) which take a [TemplateSource](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateSource.html)
* easier to configure whitespace handling via the **escapeMarkup** property on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) and [RenderContext](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/RenderContext.html) so its easy to configure markup escaping for an entire project or enable/disable it within templates.
