      td
        :markdown
          Reference for the Jade template language. 
          Jade is a modified dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) and is a very DRY template engine for generating HTML; its even a little DRYer than [Scaml](scaml-reference.html)

          # [Mustache](mustache.html) 
      td
        :markdown
          Reference for the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) template language.
          Mustache provides logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js) - so ideal for HTML templates

      td(cellvalign="middle")
        :markdown
          # [Scaml](scaml-reference.html)
      td
        :markdown
          Reference for the Scaml template language. 
          Scaml is a Scala version of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) and is a very DRY template engine for generating HTML

          # [SSP](ssp-reference.html)
      td
        :markdown
          Reference for the SSP template language. 
          SSP is a Scala version of [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/), JSP or Erb from Rails so its easy to pick up if you've used one of those and can be used to generate any textual output.
    tr
      td(cellvalign="middle")
        :markdown
          # [Scuery](scuery.html)
      td
        :markdown
          Not really a template language but Scuery provides a way to transform HTML using CSS3 selectors rather like jQuery which can be useful for transforming layouts or pages owned by a designer using a Scala DSL.
