Using SBT (Simple Build Tool) to build fast

## Building with SBT

You can use [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) as a build tool - its particularly well suited to rapid edit-compile-test cycles.

### Setting up SBT

The first time you run *sbt* you need to tell it to update its dependencies from the maven pom.xml files. So type

    ./sbt
    update
    
You should now have the project loaded and the dependencies updated from the maven poms. 

### A normal build

If you have not done so already, start a sbt shell

    ./sbt
    
To build things type
    
    compile

To run the test cases

    test
 
### Incremental builds
   
To sit in incremental mode, re-running all the test cases as you edit code

    ~ test
    
Or to just re-run failed test cases interactively

    ~ test-quick
