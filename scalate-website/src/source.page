Scalate stores its source code in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository hosted on [github](http://github.com) at this location:

* [http://github.com/scalate/scalate](http://github.com/scalate/scalate)

If you are new to Git you might like to try the [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

You can [browse the repository online](http://github.com/scalate/scalate) if you prefer.
