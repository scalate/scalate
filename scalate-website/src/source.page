# Source Repository

The *{project_name:}* project stores its source code in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository hosted on [github](http://github.com) at this location:

* [http://github.com/scalate/scalate](http://github.com/scalate/scalate)

If you are new to Git you might like to try the [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

You can [browse the repository online](http://github.com/scalate/scalate) if you prefer.

## How to Checkout

Read only access to the repository is available at the following URL:

* **git://github.com/scalate/scalate.git**

You must first install a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/download). Then you clone the repository using the following:

    git clone git://github.com/scalate/scalate.git
    cd {project_id:}

Now you probably want to try [build the scalate code]({relocatable: building.html}) 

## Committer access
