    * [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/#{project_version}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) is the main class you need to start with
    [RenderContext](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/#{project_version}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/RenderContext.html) is the context used to render a template which has a bunch of helper methods for including other templates, rendering expressions and so forth
    * [org.fusesource.scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/#{project_version}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/package.html) the core scalate package has the core public API you need if you want to work directly with the API
    * [full scaladoc](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/#{project_version}/scalate-core/scaladocs/index.html) contains the full detail of all packages if you want to write a plugin or work on the implementation or integration layers

    **NOTE** we will be including ScalaDocs of releases inside distributions and on the website once the [maven-scala-plugin 2.13.2](http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/maven-scala-plugin/) is released to work with Scala 2.8.0. See [this issue](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/61-when-2-13-2-of-maven-scala-plugin-comes-out--lets-switch---include-scaladoc-in-the-distribution) for more detail
