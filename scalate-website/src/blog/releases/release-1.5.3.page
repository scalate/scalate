The [Scalate team](http://scalate.github.io/scalate) is pleased to announce the
availability of Scalate 1.5.3

Scalate is a [Scala 2.9.1](http://www.scala-lang.org) based <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)">template
engine</a> which can be used stand alone, with servlets or web frameworks
like [JAXRS](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/jog.html),
[Lift](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/lift.html) or
[Play](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) or in integration frameworks
like [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html).

The following template languages are supported through the same common API:

* [Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax)
  which is like a Scala version of [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/),
  JSP or Erb from Rails
* [Scaml](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html)
  which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for very DRY
  markup along with the
  [Jade](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/jade.html) syntax
* [Mustache](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/mustache.html)
  which is a Scala dialect of [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) for
  logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using
  [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

All expressions inside
[Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax),
[Scaml](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html)
and [Jade](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/jade.html) benefit
from the full power and expressiveness of Scala plus they are typesafe and
checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your
templates.


**Scalate 1.5.3 Highlights**

* Scalate now uses the [Scala Presentation Compiler](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scalate/3mrkmrXK7vs/7nBh96DPT4YJ) to boost performance of template compilation 3-10X
* Support for compiling stand alone CoffeeScript files on the server, CoffeeScript filters and various CoffeeScript related bug fixes 
* A [pure Java API](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/129) to working with Scalate
