The [Scalate team](http://scalate.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce the availability of Scalate 1.3.1. 

Scalate is a [Scala 2.8](http://www.scala-lang.org) based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)">template engine</a> which can be used stand alone, with servlets or web frameworks like [JAXRS](${uri("/documentation/jog.html")}), [Lift](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/lift.html) or [Play](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) or in integration frameworks like [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html).

The following template languages are supported through the same common API:

* [Ssp](${uri("/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax")}) which is like a Scala version of [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/), JSP or Erb from Rails 
* [Scaml](${uri("/documentation/scaml-reference.html")}) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for very DRY markup along with the [Jade](${uri("/documentation/jade.html")}) syntax
* [Mustache](${uri("/documentation/mustache.html")}) which is a Scala dialect of [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

All expressions inside [Ssp](${uri("/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax")}), [Scaml](${uri("/documentation/scaml-reference.html")}) and [Jade](${uri("/documentation/jade.html")}) benefit from the full power and expressiveness of Scala plus they are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your templates.


**Scalate 1.3.1 Highlights**

This release is mostly a bug fix release.

* for folks migrating from Erb, [Ssp](${uri("/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax")}) now supports Erb style comments e.g. 

    &lt;%# this is a comment %&gt;

* [ScalatePackage classes](${uri("/documentation/user-guide.html#dry")}) can now be properly auto-detected for templates which reside in the WEB-INF directory in a web application.
* works inside OSGi containers
* all documentation now correctly included in the distro

[Feedback](${uri("/community.html")}) is always welcome!
