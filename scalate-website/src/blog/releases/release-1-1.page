The [Scalate team](http://scalate.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce the availability of Scalate 1.1. 

Scalate is a [Scala 2.8](http://www.scala-lang.org) based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)">template engine</a> which can be used stand alone, with servlets, in JAXRS, with the [Play Framework](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) or in [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html). (Work on lift integration is [in progress](https://liftweb.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/tickets/475)).

All expressions inside Scalate benefit from the full power of Scala plus they are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your templates.

Two template languages are currently supported:

* [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) which is like a Scala version of [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/), JSP or Erb from Rails 
* [Scaml](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for very DRY markup

**Scalate 1.1 Highlights**

* [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) now supports [Velocity style directives](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#velocity_style_directives) for more concise looping and branching.
* new [Scalate Tool](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/tool.html) for creating new projects with Scalate more easily
* improved API for working with templates from different sources (file, URL, Source, String etc) via the helper methods on [TemplateSource object](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/1.1/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateSource$.html) and methods on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/1.1/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) which take a [TemplateSource](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/1.1/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateSource.html)
* easier to configure whitespace handling via the **escapeMarkup** property on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/1.1/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) and [RenderContext](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/1.1/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/RenderContext.html) so its easy to configure markup escaping for an entire project or enable/disable it within templates.
