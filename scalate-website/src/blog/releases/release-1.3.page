The [Scalate team](http://scalate.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce the availability of Scalate 1.3. 

Scalate is a [Scala 2.8](http://www.scala-lang.org) based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)">template engine</a> which can be used stand alone, with servlets or web frameworks like [JAXRS](${uri("/documentation/jog.html")}), [Lift](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/lift.html) or [Play](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) or in integration frameworks like [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html).

The following template languages are supported through the same common API:

* [Ssp](${uri("/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax")}) which is like a Scala version of [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/), JSP or Erb from Rails 
* [Scaml](${uri("/documentation/scaml-reference.html")}) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for very DRY markup along with the [Jade](${uri("/documentation/jade.html")}) syntax
* [Mustache](${uri("/documentation/mustache.html")}) which is a Scala dialect of [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

All expressions inside [Ssp](${uri("/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax")}), [Scaml](${uri("/documentation/scaml-reference.html")}) and [Jade](${uri("/documentation/jade.html")}) benefit from the full power and expressiveness of Scala plus they are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your templates.


**Scalate 1.3 Highlights**

* [Jade](${uri("/documentation/jade.html")}) template syntax is now supported which is a dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) or [Scaml](${uri("/documentation/scaml-reference.html")})
* New [Servlet Filter](${uri("/documentation/user-guide.html#using_scalate_as_servlet_filter_in_your_web_application")}) which allows more flexible mapping of templates in a web application. For example you can have the request */foo.xml* automatically bound to */foo.xml.ssp* if the template exists letting you easily implement views without requiring a controller or routing in your MVC layer. 
* [JSP Converter](${uri("/documentation/jspConvert.html")}) helps you migrate your existing JSP web application across to Scalate
* [HTML Converter](${uri("/documentation/htmlConvert.html")}) lets you migrate your existing HTML files easily to [Scaml](${uri("/documentation/scaml-reference.html")}) or [Jade](${uri("/documentation/jade.html")}) for extra DRY markup 
* [DRY template imports, values and logic](${uri("/documentation/user-guide.html#dry")}) thanks to Scalate Package objects which allow imports, values and methods to be shared across some or all of your templates to reduce noise inside your templates.
* [Site Generator](${uri("/documentation/siteGen.html")}) lets you generate static or dynamic websites using templates and/or wiki markup together with exporting wiki content from Confluence wikis to migrate to using git/svn as your wiki content repository. You can also use [a common bootstrap approach](${uri("/documentation/siteGen.html#bootstrapping")}) now across both static website generation and web applications - such as to configure wiki macros in a canonical way. We now eat our own dog food and generate this site using Scalate.
* More filters and pipelines supported such as confluence as well as the existing markdown which are particularly useful for website generation (static or semi-static).
* The [Scalate Tool](${uri("/documentation/tool.html")}) now comes with a full interactive shell with full tab completion to make it easier to use the tool either for ad hoc or interactive shell use.
